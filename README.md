# host v6

Version 5 was kinda the best yet still really a mess.

This version will be (likely) the last version, and hopefully the best

## Openness

This new version is open-source, because I believe that when I code in the open, it'll inherintly get seen, and the following happen:

1. People will shit on me if I do something stupid, which means I'll avoid stupid stuff
2. It's a better security practice; if I were to go from closed-source to open, I'd likely leak secrets and random stuff, or have to review all the code. ugh....
3. Anybody can host it

## Self-hosting instructions

...coming soon
